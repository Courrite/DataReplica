# Replica Framework with Remote System
A flexible data replication system for Roblox games with an enhanced Remote communication layer.

## Overview
This framework provides a robust client-server data synchronization system for Roblox games. It consists of three main components:

1. **ReplicaService** - Server-side management of replicated data
2. **ReplicaController** - Client-side consumption of replicated data

The system allows developers to create, update, and destroy replicated data structures that automatically synchronize between server and clients with minimal network overhead.

## Features
- **Data Replication**: Automatically sync data between server and clients
- **Tag-based Filtering**: Subscribe clients only to relevant data
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for parent-child relationships between replicas
- **Efficient Updates**: Only send changed data over the network
- **Flexible Subscription**: Fine-grained control over which players receive updates
